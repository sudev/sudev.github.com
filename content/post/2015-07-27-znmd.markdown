One of the Bollywood movies which I always loved watching has been ZNMD, here is a collection of shayari recited by Farhan Akthar (Imran) in ZNMD.

### Apne Hone Par Mujhko Yaqeen Aa Gaya
(The poem comes after the trio’s deep-sea dive)

> Pighle neelam sa behta ye sama,             
> neeli neeli si khamoshiyan,          
> na kahin hai zameen na kahin aasmaan,        
> sarsaraati hui tehniyaan pattiyaan,         
> keh raheen hai bas ek tum ho yahan,      
> bas main hoon, meri saansein hain aur meri dhadkanein,     
> aisi gehraiyaan, aisi tanhaiyaan, aur main... sirf main.    
> Apne hone par mujhko yakeen aa gaya.    


The moment seems to flow like a molten sapphire and there’s deep blue silence,    
Neither there is earth below, nor sky above,    
The rustling branches, leaves are saying that only you are here,    
Only me, my breath and my heartbeat,     
Such deepness, such loneliness and me…only me,   
It all makes me believe in my existence.    


### Ye Jaane Kaisa Raaz Hai
(comes when their journey with Laila comes to an end and depicts the feelings of Arjun's heart)

> Ek baat honthon tak hai jo aai nahin     
> bus aankhon se hai jhaankti        
> tumse kabhi mujhse kabhi           
> kuch lafz hai wo maangti            
> jinko pahan ke honthon tak aa jaye wo     
> aawaz ki baahon mein baahein daal ke ithlaye wo     
> lekin ye jo ek baat hai       
> ehsaas hi ehsaas hai        
> khushboo si hai jaise hawa mein tairti        
> khushboo jo be-aawaz hai          
> jiska pata tumko bhi hai jiski khabar mujhko bhi hai          
> duniya se bhi chhupta nahin          
> ye jaane kaisa raaz hai            


A thought came alive, but away it hid        
It stole a glance under the eyelids         
Sometime form you sometimes from me       
It asked for words to set it free        
Words to wear, so from the lips it can flee    
A voice it can embrace and sway with glee        
But this thought is a feeling.....just a feeling       
Like a fragrance floating in the breeze           
A fragrance that is unspeaking         
You live with it, I'm aware of it          
Out in the open for the world to see          
What is this unknown mystery          

### Dil Aakhir Tu Kyun Rota Hai
(The poem comes when Farhan is heartbroken after meeting his estranged dad)

> Jab jab dard ka baadal chaya           
> Jab ghum ka saya lehraya           
> Jab aansoo palkon tak aya           
> Jab yeh tanha dil ghabraya           
> Humne dil ko yeh samjhaya           
> Dil aakhir tu kyun rota hai                     
> Duniya mein yunhi hota hai           
> Yeh jo gehre sannaate hain           
> Waqt ne sabko hi baante hain           
> Thoda ghum hai sabka qissa           
> Thodi dhoop hai sabka hissa           
> Aankh teri bekaar hi namm hai           
> Har pal ek naya mausam hai           
> Kyun tu aise pal khota hai           
> Dil aakhir tu kyun rota hai          

When clouds of pain loom in the sky        
When a shadow of sadness flickers by         
When tears find its way to eye          
When fear keeps loneliness alive          
I try and console my heart          
Why is it that you cry? I ask          
This is the only what life imparts           
These deep silences within           
Have been handed out to all by time          
Everyones story has a little sorrow          
Everyone's share has a little Sunshine          
No need of water in the eyes          
Every moment can be a new life          
Why do you let them pass you by           
Oh heart why is it that you cry?          

### Toh Zinda Ho Tum
(The poem comes in the climax)  


> Dilon mein tum apni          
> Betaabiyan leke chal rahe ho          
> Toh zinda ho tum                    
> Nazar mein khwabon ki          
> Bijliyan leke chal rahe ho          
> Toh zinda ho tum          
> Hawa ke jhokon ke jaise          
> Aazad rehno sikho          
> Tum ek dariya ke jaise          
> Lehron mein behna sikho          
> Har ek lamhe se tum milo          
> Khole apni bhaayein          
> Har ek pal ek naya samha          
> Dekhen yeh nigahaein          
> Jo apni aankhon mein          
> Hairaniyan leke chal rahe ho          
> Toh zinda ho tum          
> Dilon mein tum apni          
> Betaabiyan leke chal rahe ho                   
> Toh zinda ho tum                  

If you are carrying your restlessness in your heart You are alive        
If you are carrying the lightning of dreams in your eyes       
You are alive       
Like a gust of wind,learn to live free          
Learn to flow like the waves that make a sea            
Let your arms be wide open,to every moment you meet          
May every moment gift you a new sight to greet         
If you are carrying your wonder in your eyes         
You are alive          
If you are carrying your restlessness in your heart        
You are alive!
