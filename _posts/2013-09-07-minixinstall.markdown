This article will help you in setting up Minix 3 using VirtualBox on a Linux Host for development.


Downloading Minix 3
===================

Download Minix 3 from the official website

http://www.minix3.org/download/

Note: I used the Minix version 3.2.1(265 MB), Minix 3.1 versions have some issues with VirtualBox installation so please use a version > 3.2 .

Creating a new VirtualBox Image
===============================

Make sure you have a VirtualBox install in your system.

Open VirtualBox -> Click on the New button seen at the top left.

Select the type and version as others, name the virtualbox image as minix.

Click next, allot a RAM ( 512 MB) 

Create a virtual hard disk ( preferably VDI, dynamic size, 1 GB)
