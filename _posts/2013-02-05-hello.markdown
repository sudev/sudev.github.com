I always wanted very clean and simple interface for my blog, I use to blog 
here [blogger](sudevshares.blogspot.com) with an ugly theme now that some 
nice guy [zachholman.com]open-sourced this theme with Jekyll I'm kinda more than satisfied.

If you havent used Jkeyll yet I recommend you to use it along with github pages.
