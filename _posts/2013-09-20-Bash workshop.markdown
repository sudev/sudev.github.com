Basic Navigation
================

cd   - Change directory. This lets you navigate to different directories (folders).

    Examples:

    cd Documents
        go into a subdirectory (of the current directory) named "Documents"
    cd Documents/temp
        go into "Documents", then from there into a subdirectory named "temp"
    cd ..
        go up to the parent of the current directory
    cd ../..
        go up two levels, to the parent's parent
    cd ~
        go to your home directory (note: that's a tilde, not a dash)
    cd -
        go back to the previous directory 

pwd   - Print working directory. This prints the path of the current working directory (i.e. it tells you where you are).

ls   - List the files in the current directory, and (optionally) their characteristics.

    Examples:

    ls
        list just the names of the files in the current directory
    ls -l
        (long) list the files with their characteristics (size, privs, owner, etc)
    ls -a
        list all files in the current directory (including those that would normally be invisible)
    ls *.jpg
        list the names of all files with names ending in ".jpg"
    ls a*
        list the names of all files with names beginning with "a"
    ls *att*
        list the names of all files with names containing "att" 
        
Manipulating Files and Folders:
===============================

cp   - Copy a file (or directory).

    Examples:

    cp foo bar
        copy a file named "foo" (in the current directory); name the copy "bar"
    cp foo ~/Documents/bar
        copy a file named "a" (in the current directory) into your Documents directory and name the copy "bar"
    cp *.jpg ~/Documents
        copy all files with names ending in ".jpg" into your Documents directory
    cp -R Documents "Documents backup"
        copy an entire directory named "Documents"; name the copy "Documents backup". The quotes are needed because of the space in the directory name.

rm   - Remove (delete) a file or directory.

    Examples:

    rm foo
        delete the file named "foo"
    rm a*
        delete all files with names beginning with "a"
    rm -R temp
        delete the directory named "temp", and all of its contents 

mkdir   - Make directory - equivalent to the Finder's New Folder command.

    Example:

    mkdir foo
        Create a new directory named "foo" 

chmod   - Change protection mode on files and folders. It's rather complex, so read the man page before using. You must own the files (or be root) to change their protections.

    Examples:

    chmod u+w foo
        Allow the user (file owner) write access to the file or folder named "foo"
    chmod u-r foo
        Disallow the user (file owner) read access to "foo"
    chmod ug+x foo
        Allow the user (file owner) and group members execute access to "foo"
    chmod o+rX *
        Allow "other"s read and maybe execute access to all files in the current directory. The capital "X" tells chmod to use a complicated set of rules for setting execute access only where it's appropriate; it generally works fairly well.
    chmod o-rwx ~/Public
        Disallow "other"s (mainly guests) from accessing your Public directory
