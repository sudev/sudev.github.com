If you want to know your battery details within terminal you can upower and create an alias to it so that you dont have to type the entire command next time.


To view battery detail you can use upower

```
upower -i /org/freedesktop/UPower/devices/battery_BAT0
```

Use grep to show only the required details 

```
upower -i /org/freedesktop/UPower/devices/battery_BAT0 | grep -E "state|time|per"
```

Create an alias 

```
alias bat='upower -i /org/freedesktop/UPower/devices/battery_BAT0 | grep -E "state|time|per"'
```

Add  alias to .bashrc file and make it permemanent.
