If you want to know your battery details in terminal use upower and create an alias to it so that you dont have to type the entire command next time.


To view battery details using upower

```
upower -i /org/freedesktop/UPower/devices/battery_BAT0
```

Grep to view only the required details 

```
upower -i /org/freedesktop/UPower/devices/battery_BAT0 | grep -E "state|time|per"
```

Create an alias 

```
alias bat='upower -i /org/freedesktop/UPower/devices/battery_BAT0 | grep -E "state|time|per"'
```

Add  alias to .bashrc file and make it permemanent.
