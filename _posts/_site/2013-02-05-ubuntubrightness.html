<p>This tutorial will help you to adjust the screen brightness in Ubuntu 12.04 / Linux Mint 13 during each boot automatically.</p>

<p>Tested in Intel i7 laptop with Nvidia Graphics Card, this idea will work only if you have a file named brightness in /sys/class/backlight/acpi_video0</p>

<p>To know your systems current brightness level.</p>

<p><code>
cat /sys/class/backlight/acpi_video0/brightness
</code></p>

<p>Change brightness by changing the value</p>

<p><code>
echo 0 &gt; /sys/class/backlight/acpi_video0/brightness
</code></p>

<p>To permanently set the brightness you can use the rc.loacal script file to change brightness which is executed at each reboot</p>

<p><code>
sudo gedit /etc/rc.local
</code></p>

<p>add the following line above &#8220;exit 0&#8221; seen at the bottom of the document</p>

<p><code>
echo 0 &gt; /sys/class/backlight/acpi_video0/brightness
</code></p>

<p>restart your system after saving the file.</p>
