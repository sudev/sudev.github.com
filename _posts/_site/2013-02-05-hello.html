<p>I always wanted very clean and simple interface for my blog, I use to blog using <a href='http://www.sudevshares.blogspot.com'>blogger</a> with an ugly theme now that some nice guy <a href='http://www.zachholman.com'>zachholman.com</a> open sourced this theme with Jekyll I&#8217;m kinda more than satisfied.</p>

<p>If you havent used Jkeyll yet I recommend you to use it along with github pages.</p>
