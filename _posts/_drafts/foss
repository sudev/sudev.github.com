I have been not able to think about anything other than the Kid, the Wall and FOSSMeet for the last one month. I dont know why I'm writing this maybe someone could help me to think better out of this situation I don't know.    

## FOSSMeet Preparation

During the month of December and January I worked to find quality speakers to speak at FOSSMeet '14. The idea was to find someone who can motivate our students to code and contribute to the open source community. We don't have many of our college who contributes to open source, we don't really have lots of quality coders (I agree that most of us are really good with theoretical computer science) in our college. But there is a difference when you contribute to opensource you are actually doing something of higher quality, think of a situation where you are able to contribute to some mainstream open source project and then millions of people using it.       
<br />Many of us never understood that undergraduation period is the best time to do a lot of projects, we have lots of free time most of us (including me) never taught by using it to better our skills and doing something good for the community. I wanted my juniors to know more about open source and help them to contribute. This was the idea behind my involvement in FOSSMeet '14.             
<br />One more thing I have noticed in here is that we do bring in quality speakers and advanced talks for FOSSMeet but I would say that it's not really useful for the students as 80% of our students due to lack of proper Linux basics finds it really hard to understand the talk. So we(Team FOSSMeet) taught it will be really helpful if we could bring in some speakers to give some beginner talks to our students so that they can build their basics properly. With lots of issues (including sponsorship for FOSSMeet '14) somehow we were able to call about 15 good speakers for the event. During all these happening I was feeling so much better inside that me along with FOSSMeet Team will be doing something really good to our college.       

## FOSSMeet Happens 
We got a lot of help from our Department, FOSSCell pass outs, Alumini's and from random free software enthusiasts. It was scheduled to happen at February 14th to February 16th we did release a new website and a lot of funny posters too. Many of us were happy to know that we had a very good pool of speakers this time and registration almost crossed 250 mark with about 150 of being students from other colleges and professionals. FOSSMeet started really well. We were satisfied for the amount of work that we did during past couple of months (We were rather a small team this time around).
